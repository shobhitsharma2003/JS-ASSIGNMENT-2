# MyToken Smart Contract
 This is a simple Ethereum ERC-20 token smart contract written in Solidity. The contract allows for token creation, transfer, and burning functionalities.
 
## Features
 -> Token Creation: The contract allows for the creation of a new ERC-20 token with a specified name, symbol, and initial supply.
 -> Token Minting: Additional tokens can be minted and added to the total token supply.
 -> Token Burning: Tokens can be burned, reducing the total token supply.

### Installation
 -> Clone the repository or download the MyToken.sol file.
 -> Compile the Solidity code using a Solidity compiler (e.g Remix IDE).
 -> Deploy the compiled smart contract to an Ethereum blockchain network using Remix IDE.

#### Usage
 -> Deploy the contract to an Ethereum blockchain network.
 -> Specify the desired token name, symbol, and initial supply when deploying the contract.
 -> Use the 'mint' function to mint new tokens and add them to the total token supply.
 -> Use the 'burn' function to burn tokens and reduce the total token supply.
